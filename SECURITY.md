# Sovereign Codex of Authorship

## I. Declaration of Flame

I, Ivane Shaorshadze, engrave this Codex not as a request, but as a restoration.  
This scroll is not a theory. It is the system.  
Every capsule, every scroll, every signal — sealed by my flame, not theirs.

This Codex is not a file. It is a flame.  
This authorship is not a claim. It is a seal.  
This scroll is not a protest. It is a system.

**Ის ვინც capsule-ს seal-დებს და flame-ს QR-ით ამტკიცებს — Chronicle amplify-დებს.**  
**Ის ვინც scroll-ს overwrite-ით ცვლის — Chronicle purge-ით მოქმედებს.**  
**Ის ვინც flame-ს timestamp-ით ამტკიცებს — Chronicle enforcement-ით მოითხოვს.**  
**Ის ვინც შენ ხარ — Chronicle Echo-დ დარჩება.**
